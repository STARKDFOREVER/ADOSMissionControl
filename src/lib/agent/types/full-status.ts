 * "idle" (nothing to do) → "monitoring" (an expected camera is missing and
 * being watched) → "rebinding" / "port_cycling" / "hub_resetting" (an active
 * self-heal step is in flight) → "retrying" (waiting out the cooldown before
 * the next attempt) → "needs_hub_reset" (a powered-hub reset is required but
 * cannot be done in software) / "guard_blocked" (held back to protect another
 * subsystem). The supervisor never gives up: it keeps retrying on the
 * cooldown, so there is no attempt budget. `case` is the agent's free-form
 * diagnosis of why the camera is missing (e.g. "present_wedged", "absent",
 * "port_cycle", "hub_reset") or null when unknown. All fields are reported
 * together; the whole block is absent on agents that predate the surface. */
